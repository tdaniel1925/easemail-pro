# AI-Powered Email Threading System - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

We've built a **state-of-the-art AI-powered email threading system** that groups related emails into conversations and provides intelligent insights, summaries, and timeline visualizations.

### Key Features

✅ **Smart Thread Detection**
- RFC 2822 header-based threading (In-Reply-To, References)
- Subject normalization and matching
- Participant overlap detection
- AI-powered edge case handling
- Cross-account thread linking

✅ **AI-Powered Thread Intelligence**
- Automatic thread summaries
- Decision extraction
- Action item identification
- Key topic detection
- Sentiment analysis
- Priority detection
- Reply prediction

✅ **Visual Timeline**
- Chronological event display
- Participant tracking
- Quick navigation to individual emails
- Event metadata (attachments, mentions, etc.)

✅ **Interactive UI**
- Thread badge on email cards (🔗 with count)
- Click-to-expand thread summary panel
- Inline display (no modal needed)
- Quick actions (mute, archive, star)
- Action item completion tracking

✅ **Zero Breaking Changes**
- Works seamlessly with existing email system
- Backwards compatible
- Opt-in threading (emails without threads still work)
- Progressive enhancement

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Thread Detection Flow

```
New Email Arrives
    ↓
ThreadingService.detectThread()
    ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Method 1: Headers   │ (High Confidence)
│ - Provider threadId │
│ - In-Reply-To       │
│ - References        │
└─────────┬───────────┘
          ↓ Not Found
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Method 2: Subject   │ (Medium Confidence)
│ - Normalize subject │
│ - Check participants│
└─────────┬───────────┘
          ↓ Not Found
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Method 3: AI        │ (Low Confidence)
│ - Analyze context   │
│ - Match participants│
└─────────┬───────────┘
          ↓
    Create New Thread OR Add to Existing Thread
```

### 2. User Interaction Flow

```
User sees email list
    ↓
Email has thread badge (🔗 3)
    ↓
User clicks badge
    ↓
ThreadSummaryPanel expands inline
    ↓
Shows:
├─ AI Summary
├─ Thread Stats (participants, emails, attachments)
├─ Decisions Made
├─ Action Items (with completion tracking)
├─ Key Topics
├─ Thread Emails (clickable list)
└─ Timeline Tab (visual chronology)
    ↓
User clicks email in list → Navigate to that email
User clicks action → Complete, Mute, Archive, Star
```

### 3. AI Summary Generation

```
User clicks "Regenerate" OR API call triggered
    ↓
Fetch all emails in thread (max 50)
    ↓
Send to OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:
├─ Email metadata (from, date, subject)
├─ Snippets of content
└─ Analysis prompt
    ↓
AI returns JSON:
├─ summary (2-3 sentences)
├─ decisions (array)
├─ actionItems (array)
├─ keyTopics (array)
├─ sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
├─ category (discussion/decision/info/action)
├─ priority (urgent/high/normal/low)
└─ needsReply (boolean)
    ↓
Save to database → Cache for future use
```

## 🛠️ Migration & Setup

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Apply migration
psql -d your_database < drizzle/migrations/0010_add_email_threads.sql
```

### 2. Analyze Existing Emails

```bash
# Link existing emails into threads
npx tsx scripts/migrate-email-threads.ts

# With AI summary generation (optional, uses OpenAI)
npx tsx scripts/migrate-email-threads.ts --generate-summaries
```

**Migration Process:**
1. Scans all emails in database
2. Detects threads using headers, subjects, participants
3. Creates thread records
4. Links emails to threads
5. Optionally generates AI summaries

**Expected Output:**
```
🔄 Starting email threading migration...
📊 Found 3 users with emails

👤 Processing user abc-123
   📧 Total emails: 150
   ✨ Created new thread: 1a2b3c4d... (Meeting follow-up)
   🔗 Added to thread: 1a2b3c4d... (Re: Meeting follow-up)
   📈 Progress: 50/150 emails processed
   ✅ User abc-123 complete:
      - Threads created: 45
      - Emails linked: 150

📊 Migration Complete!
═══════════════════════════════════════
Total emails: 450
Emails linked to threads: 450
Total threads created: 120
Success rate: 100.00%
═══════════════════════════════════════
```

### 3. Update Email Sync

To automatically thread new incoming emails, update your email sync logic:

```typescript
// In your email sync function
import { ThreadingService } from '@/lib/email/threading-service';

async function syncEmail(nylasMessage: Message) {
  // Save email to database
  const savedEmail = await saveEmailToDb(nylasMessage);
  
  // Detect and link to thread
  const threadDetection = await ThreadingService.detectThread(
    savedEmail,
    userId
  );
  
  let threadId: string;
  
  if (threadDetection.isNewThread) {
    threadId = await ThreadingService.createThread(savedEmail, userId);
  } else if (threadDetection.threadId) {
    threadId = threadDetection.threadId;
    await ThreadingService.addToThread(threadId, savedEmail);
  }
  
  // Update email with threadId
  await db.update(emails)
    .set({ threadId })
    .where(eq(emails.id, savedEmail.id));
}
```

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Database Caching
- Thread summaries cached in DB (generated once)
- Only regenerate on explicit user request

### 2. React Query Caching
```typescript
// Thread data cached for 2 minutes
staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000
```

### 3. Lazy Loading
- Thread summary only fetched when badge clicked
- Timeline events limited to 50 most recent

### 4. Efficient Queries
- Indexed on `threadId`, `userId`, `lastActivityAt`, `needsReply`
- Participant queries optimized with email index

## 🚀 Advanced Features (Already Built-In)

### Cross-Account Threading
Threads can span multiple email accounts. If you reply from a different account, the thread persists.

```typescript
accountIds: ['account-1', 'account-2']  // Thread across accounts
```

### Predictive Features
```typescript
needsReply: true  // AI predicts you should reply
predictedNextAction: 'reply'  // AI suggests next action
```

### Thread Muting
Mute a thread to stop notifications but keep emails accessible.

### Bulk Thread Actions
Archive, mute, or delete all emails in a thread at once.

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Thread Badge Style

Edit `components/email/EmailList.tsx`:
```typescript
<button
  className={cn(
    "flex items-center gap-1 px-2 py-1 rounded-full transition-all",
    showThread 
      ? "bg-primary text-primary-foreground"  // Active state
      : "bg-primary/10 hover:bg-primary/20 text-primary"  // Inactive
  )}
>
  <MessageSquare className="h-3 w-3" />
  <span className="text-xs font-medium">{email.threadEmailCount}</span>
</button>
```

### Customize AI Prompt

Edit `lib/email/threading-service.ts`:
```typescript
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'system',
      content: `Your custom prompt here...`,
    },
    // ...
  ],
});
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Thread Not Showing Badge

**Possible causes:**
1. Email doesn't have `threadId` set
2. `threadEmailCount` is 1 or less
3. Database needs migration

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-run migration
npx tsx scripts/migrate-email-threads.ts
```

### AI Summary Not Generating

**Possible causes:**
1. OpenAI API key not set
2. Thread has no emails
3. Network/API error

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Manually regenerate
# Click "Regenerate" button in UI
```

### Thread Panel Not Expanding

**Possible causes:**
1. `threadId` is null/invalid
2. TypeScript error in console
3. API endpoint not responding

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint is running: `GET /api/threads/[threadId]`
3. Check database has `email_threads` table

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Easy to Add)

### 1. Smart Thread Splitting
If a thread goes off-topic, AI can suggest splitting it into two threads.

### 2. Thread Merging
Merge two threads that are actually about the same topic.

### 3. Thread Subscriptions
Subscribe to a thread and get notifications for new emails.

### 4. Thread Search
Search across all threads by summary, decisions, or action items.

### 5. Thread Analytics
- Average response time
- Most active participants
- Thread resolution rate

### 6. Email Drafts in Thread Context
When composing a reply, show thread summary for context.
