## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


After reviewing all provided specifications, this project appears to be IRRELEVANT from a business logic perspective.

The project consists entirely of:
- Frontend HTML templates
- SCSS/CSS styling files
- UI animation configurations
- Standard UI component implementations
- Layout and responsive design rules

No business logic, domain-specific algorithms, data transformations or unique workflows are present in the codebase. The files contain purely presentational code focused on:
- Visual styling 
- Animations
- Page layouts
- UI components
- Typography
- Theme configurations

Importance Score: 0/100

Since no actual business logic exists in these frontend presentation files, no further technical documentation of business components is warranted.
