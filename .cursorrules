## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


After reviewing all provided specifications, this project appears to be IRRELEVANT from a business logic perspective.

The project consists entirely of:
- Frontend HTML templates
- SCSS/CSS styling files
- UI animation configurations
- Standard UI component implementations
- Layout and responsive design rules

No business logic, domain-specific algorithms, data transformations or unique workflows are present in the codebase. The files contain purely presentational code focused on:
- Visual styling 
- Animations
- Page layouts
- UI components
- Typography
- Theme configurations

Importance Score: 0/100

Since no actual business logic exists in these frontend presentation files, no further technical documentation of business components is warranted.

These examples should be used as guidance when configuring Sentry functionality within a project.

# Exception Catching

Use `Sentry.captureException(error)` to capture an exception and log the error in Sentry.
Use this in try catch blocks or areas where exceptions are expected

# Tracing Examples

Spans should be created for meaningful actions within an applications like button clicks, API calls, and function calls
Use the `Sentry.startSpan` function to create a span
Child spans can exist within a parent span

## Custom Span instrumentation in component actions

The `name` and `op` properties should be meaninful for the activities in the call.
Attach attributes based on relevant information and metrics from the request

```javascript
function TestComponent() {
  const handleTestButtonClick = () => {
    // Create a transaction/span to measure performance
    Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        op: "ui.click",
        name: "Test Button Click",
      },
      (span) => {
        const value = "some config";
        const metric = "some metric";

        // Metrics can be added to the span
        span.setAttribute("config", value);
        span.setAttribute("metric", metric);

        doSomething();
      },
    );
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleTestButtonClick}>
      Test Sentry
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Custom span instrumentation in API calls

The `name` and `op` properties should be meaninful for the activities in the call.
Attach attributes based on relevant information and metrics from the request

```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
  return Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      op: "http.client",
      name: `GET /api/users/${userId}`,
    },
    async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      return data;
    },
  );
}
```

# Logs

Where logs are used, ensure Sentry is imported using `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs"`
Enable logging in Sentry using `Sentry.init({ _experiments: { enableLogs: true } })`
Reference the logger using `const { logger } = Sentry`
Sentry offers a consoleLoggingIntegration that can be used to log specific console error types automatically without instrumenting the individual logger calls

## Configuration

In NextJS the client side Sentry initialization is in `instrumentation-client.ts`, the server initialization is in `sentry.server.config.ts` and the edge initialization is in `sentry.edge.config.ts`
Initialization does not need to be repeated in other files, it only needs to happen the files mentioned above. You should use `import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs"` to reference Sentry functionality

### Baseline

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://c6945a7fc01abf167c788d65ba655993@o4510313806757888.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510313808199680",

  _experiments: {
    enableLogs: true,
  },
});
```

### Logger Integration

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://c6945a7fc01abf167c788d65ba655993@o4510313806757888.ingest.us.sentry.io/4510313808199680",
  integrations: [
    // send console.log, console.warn, and console.error calls as logs to Sentry
    Sentry.consoleLoggingIntegration({ levels: ["log", "warn", "error"] }),
  ],
});
```

## Logger Examples

`logger.fmt` is a template literal function that should be used to bring variables into the structured logs.

```javascript
logger.trace("Starting database connection", { database: "users" });
logger.debug(logger.fmt`Cache miss for user: ${userId}`);
logger.info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 });
logger.warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", {
  endpoint: "/api/results/",
  isEnterprise: false,
});
logger.error("Failed to process payment", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 99.99,
});
logger.fatal("Database connection pool exhausted", {
  database: "users",
  activeConnections: 100,
});
```
