## 🗄️ **DATABASE IMPACT**

### Sent Emails
When you send an email, it's saved to the `emails` table with:

```sql
folder = 'sent'
folders = ['sent']
sentAt = NOW()
receivedAt = NOW()
isRead = true
fromEmail = [your account email]
toEmails = [recipients]
providerMessageId = [from Nylas/Aurinko]
```

This means:
- ✅ Sent emails appear in "Sent" folder
- ✅ They have proper timestamps
- ✅ They're marked as read
- ✅ Thread references preserved for replies

### Draft Emails
Saved to `email_drafts` table with:

```sql
userId = [current user]
accountId = [selected account]
to = [recipients array]
subject = [subject]
bodyText = [body]
bodyHtml = [body]
replyToEmailId = [if reply]
replyType = [reply/replyAll/forward]
```
