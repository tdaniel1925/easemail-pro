## **💡 User Communication:**

**Banner Text (in UI):**
> **AI Document Analysis is Disabled**  
> Enable AI to automatically classify documents as invoices, receipts, contracts, and more.

**Privacy Policy (Recommended to add):**
> When AI document analysis is enabled, EaseMail uses OpenAI's API to classify and extract data from your attachments. Files are sent securely to OpenAI for processing and deleted after 30 days per their data retention policy. Your files are never used for AI training. You can disable this feature anytime in Settings.

---

## **🎯 Marketing Benefits:**

**Now you can say:**
- ✅ "Privacy-first: AI is opt-in, not opt-out"
- ✅ "You control your data"
- ✅ "Transparent about third-party services"
- ✅ "Enterprise-ready privacy"

---

## **🚀 Next Steps (Optional):**

Want to make it even more secure?

1. **Settings UI** - Add toggle in settings page (not yet built)
2. **Sensitive File Detection** - Auto-skip medical/legal files
3. **Data Minimization** - Send only first page, not full docs
4. **Audit Trail** - Log what was processed
5. **Encryption** - Encrypt extracted metadata at rest

**Need any of these? Let me know!**
