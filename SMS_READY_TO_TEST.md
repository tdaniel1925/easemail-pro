## 📊 Check Your Data

### In Browser Console (F12)
Look for these logs:
```
📤 Sending SMS: {
  to: '+16517287626',
  segments: 1,
  encoding: 'unicode',
  cost: 0.05
}
✅ SMS sent successfully
```

### In Twilio Console
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/monitor/logs/sms
2. See your SMS log
3. Status: queued → sent → delivered (within seconds)

### In Supabase SQL Editor
Run these queries:
```sql
-- See your SMS
SELECT * FROM sms_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check usage tracking
SELECT * FROM sms_usage ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- View timeline
SELECT * FROM contact_communications ORDER BY occurred_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Check audit log
SELECT * FROM sms_audit_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```

## 🧪 Advanced Tests

### Test 1: Long Message (Multi-Segment)
Send a message with 200+ characters:
```
This is a longer test message to see how the SMS system handles messages that exceed 160 characters. It should automatically split into multiple segments and calculate the correct cost. The system should show 2 segments and $0.10 cost.
```
Expected: 2 segments, $0.10 cost

### Test 2: Rate Limiting
Try sending 11 SMS within 1 minute
- First 10 should succeed ✅
- 11th should show: "Rate limit exceeded" ❌

### Test 3: Invalid Phone
Edit contact, change phone to: "abc123"
- SMS button should still work but send will fail with validation error

### Test 4: Test Mode Numbers
When `SMS_TEST_MODE=true` in .env.local:
- Use phone: `+15551234567` → Success (no real SMS)
- Use phone: `+15559999999` → Failure (simulated)
- Use phone: `+15558888888` → Undelivered (simulated)

### Test 5: Notes Features
- Create 5 notes
- Pin 2 of them (they should move to top)
- Edit a note (inline editing)
- Delete a note (with confirmation)
