# Dashboard Screenshots

This directory contains real screenshots of the EaseMail dashboard for use in marketing materials.

## Required Screenshot

**`dashboard-main.png`** - Main dashboard view showing:
- Inbox with email list
- Email preview pane
- Calendar sidebar
- Multiple account folders
- AI features visible

### How to Create the Screenshot

1. Open your EaseMail app at `http://localhost:3000/inbox`
2. Make sure you have:
   - Multiple emails visible
   - Calendar showing on the right
   - Clean, professional looking data (no sensitive info)
3. Take a full-width screenshot (recommended: 1920px or wider)
4. Save as `dashboard-main.png` in this directory

### Tips for Great Screenshots

- Use light mode (photographs better)
- Show real features: AI summaries, multiple accounts, calendar
- Remove any sensitive/personal information
- Use professional-looking test data
- Ensure UI is fully loaded before capturing

### Current Status

⚠️ **Action Required**: Please add your dashboard screenshot as `dashboard-main.png`
