**Let's ship this! ðŸš€**

Questions? Blockers? Reach out immediately. Ship fast, iterate faster.

Remember: V1 doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be **magical** for one use case.

That use case: "I need to find that invoice, and I don't remember which email it was in."

Nail that, and everything else is gravy.

**Now go build it!** ðŸ’ª
