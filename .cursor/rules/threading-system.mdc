# threading-system

The email threading system implements a sophisticated multi-method detection algorithm with cross-account linking capabilities.

Core Threading Components:

1. Thread Detection Engine
- Primary method: RFC 2822 header analysis (In-Reply-To, References fields)
- Secondary method: Subject line normalization with participant matching
- Tertiary method: AI-powered content analysis for edge cases
- Confidence scoring system rates each detection method's results
- Thread linking uses composite scores to make final grouping decisions

2. Cross-Account Threading
- Global thread ID mapping across multiple email accounts
- Provider-specific ID normalization
- Thread state synchronization between accounts
- Participant graph analysis for relationship detection
- Timeline reconstruction across fragmented conversations

3. Thread Confidence Scoring
- Header-based matching: 0.9-1.0 confidence
- Subject + participant matching: 0.7-0.9 confidence
- AI content analysis: 0.5-0.8 confidence
- Composite scoring for final thread decisions
- Minimum confidence threshold: 0.6 for thread grouping

4. Thread State Management
- Unified thread status tracking
- Cross-account read/unread state sync
- Thread archive status propagation
- Participant list consolidation
- Last activity timestamp maintenance

Business Rules:

1. Thread Grouping Rules
- Messages must meet minimum confidence threshold
- Cross-account threads require participant overlap
- Maximum thread depth: 100 messages
- Thread splitting on subject change with low confidence
- Orphaned message handling with AI analysis

2. Thread Linking Rules
- Primary account drives thread organization
- Secondary accounts contribute supplementary messages
- Thread merging requires explicit confidence thresholds
- Cross-provider ID mapping with fallback mechanisms
- Participant matching requires email normalization

Importance Score: 95/100
This represents core business logic implementing sophisticated email organization and relationship tracking across multiple accounts and providers.
