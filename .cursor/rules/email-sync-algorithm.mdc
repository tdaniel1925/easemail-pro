# email-sync-algorithm

IMPORTANCE SCORE: 90/100

Core Synchronization Components:

1. Delta-Based Sync Engine
- Cursor-based pagination with provider-specific batch sizes
- Incremental sync using message deltas and timestamps
- Two-phase sync process:
  * Initial full sync with historical message retrieval
  * Subsequent delta syncs for new/modified messages
- Provider-specific delay handling:
  * Microsoft: 500ms between requests
  * Gmail: 100ms between requests
  * IMAP: 200ms between requests

2. Account Sync Orchestration
- Individual sync queues per account
- State machine managing sync status:
  * INITIALIZING -> SYNCING -> COMPLETED
  * ERROR -> RETRYING
  * PAUSED -> RESUMING
- Automatic sync resumption with exponential backoff
- Progress tracking with completion percentage

3. Message Threading System
- Cross-provider thread ID mapping
- Unified thread detection across accounts:
  * Message-ID header analysis
  * In-Reply-To chain tracking
  * Subject line normalization
  * Participant matching
- Real-time thread updates during sync

4. Webhook Integration
- Real-time sync triggers from provider events
- Event normalization across providers
- Priority-based processing queue:
  * HIGH: New messages
  * MEDIUM: Status changes
  * LOW: Folder updates
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed webhooks
