Provider Abstraction Layer (Importance Score: 85/100)

Core Components:

1. Provider Interface Layer
Location: lib/providers/base-provider.ts
- Abstract provider interface defining standard operations across email providers
- Unified methods for authentication, folder operations, and message handling
- Provider-specific implementation containers with consistent API surface
- Standardized error handling and rate limiting patterns

2. Folder/Label Management 
Location: lib/providers/folder-manager.ts
- Unified folder/label abstraction handling provider differences:
  - Gmail: Label-based system
  - Outlook: Hierarchical folders 
  - IMAP: Standard folders
- Two-way sync with provider-specific translation
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications
- Folder hierarchy normalization

3. Provider-Specific Authentication
Location: lib/providers/auth/*.ts
- OAuth flow management per provider
- Token refresh orchestration
- Credential storage abstraction
- Session management standardization

4. Data Model Transformations
Location: lib/providers/models/*.ts
- Message format normalization across providers
- Attachment handling standardization
- Thread ID mapping and correlation
- Provider-specific metadata preservation

5. Sync State Management
Location: lib/providers/sync-manager.ts
- Provider-agnostic sync cursor handling
- Delta sync optimization per provider
- Background sync scheduling
- Sync conflict resolution

The provider abstraction layer implements a sophisticated system for normalizing interactions across different email providers while preserving provider-specific capabilities and optimizations. Key focus areas include folder/label management, authentication flows, and data model standardization.
